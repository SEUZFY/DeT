# DeT

Delaunay triangulation and visualised using `OpenGL`.

Under construction.

The code and set up is heavily inspired by:

1. environment set up
	[ OpenGL graphics in C++ from scratch [CMake + GLFW + GLEW] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzp77cOMmfg)

2. code(to draw an example triangle)
	[Setting up OpenGL and Creating a Window in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR4fNpBjmq8)
