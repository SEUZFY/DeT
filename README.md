# DeT

Delaunay triangulation and visualised using `OpenGL`.

The algorithm is so called [Bowyer-Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm), see [here](http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/) for more details.

Under construction.

The code and set up is heavily inspired by:

1. environment set up
	[ OpenGL graphics in C++ from scratch [CMake + GLFW + GLEW] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzp77cOMmfg)

2. code(to draw an example triangle)
